## ST558 Final Project - Wenna Han

For this project, we will analyze a Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset. Specifically, the diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv data.

## Read In data
You should read about the data and especially about each variable. Many are coded numerically but most are not numeric variables.
```{r}
data <- read.csv("diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv")
head(data)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```
